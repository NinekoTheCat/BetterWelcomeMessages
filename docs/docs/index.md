# Guide
BWM is a mod that allows you to add colorful messages for players that join your server for the first time. 
These messages will also show up if their contents change!
## Requirements
- Fzzy Config
- Fabric Kotlin
- Fabric API
## Usage
After installing the required mods on the server the first step is joining it!

You might notice that after joining the server the first thing you'll see is some text urging you to change it.
There's two ways of changing the markdown message. Via the [configuration file](config_types/file.md) or the easier to
access [configuration menu](config_types/GUI.md).

!!! tip
    It is recommended to use the [configuration file](config_types/file.md) as the menu is a bit cumbersome to use.
